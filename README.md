## üì¶ Installer (Inno Setup)

The Windows installer for **SaveGem** is built using **[Inno Setup](https://jrsoftware.org/isinfo.php)**.  
We provide an `.iss` script in the repository, so you can create your own installer if needed.

### Build the Installer Yourself
1. Download and install [Inno Setup 6+](https://jrsoftware.org/isdl.php).  
2. Open `scripts/installer/setup.iss`.  
3. Compile the script from within Inno Setup to generate the `.exe` installer.

> ‚ÑπÔ∏è **Note**: The `.iss` file is only a configuration script. Inno Setup itself is **not** distributed with SaveGem, you‚Äôll need to install it separately if you want to build the installer.

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Important Note: Windows Defender Exclusion
SaveGem includes a process responsible for managing background tasks, which ensures that a single instance of the background worker is always running.

Due to the nature of this process management, Windows Defender (and similar antivirus software) may incorrectly flag the application as a threat (Trojan) and automatically remove it.

### Action Required
To prevent this issue, you must add the SaveGem installation directory to your antivirus exclusion list (e.g., Windows Defender, Avast, etc.) immediately after installation.

### Windows Defender Steps (Example)
1. Open Windows Security.
2. Go to *Virus & threat protection*.
3. Under *Virus & threat protection* settings, click *Manage settings*.
4. Scroll down to *Exclusions* and click *Add or remove exclusions*.
5. Click *Add an exclusion*, *select Folder*, and choose the SaveGem installation directory (e.g., C:\Program Files\SaveGem).
